# modern-vanilla-JS-starter-kit

The creation of a small web SPA with a modern JS ecosystem around webpack. You can comfortably create a framework agnostic JS application, but (c) "Thinking in React" with reactivity based on the Redux-toolkit and Reef.js lib.

## Features for Developers

-   Predictable Flux architecture
-   Separation of App logic and UI
-   Components architecture, rely on predictable RTK style
-   All RTK features: Redux Dev Tools, slices, immer, etc.
-   Jest and @testing-library/dom for tests
-   @babel for: es6 to es5 and correct work with jest & ESM modules
-   Husky: for hooks
-   Bootstrap (without jquery and popper.js) for simple CSS
-   CSS is Auto-Purge, while build creating
-   Automatic generation of html documentation from JSDoc + docdash as a nice looking template for JSDoc
-   Automatic README.md generation from jsdoc
-   Flexibility. Feel free to change one library from this starter kit to another. For example you can change Redux-toolkit to vanilla Redux for reduce size of final bundle
