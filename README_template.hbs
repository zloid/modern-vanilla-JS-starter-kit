# modern vanilla JS starterKit

## Target
 
To provide developers with a set of good tools to get started quickly developing of a small web SPA. You can comfortably create a framework agnostic JS application, but (c) "Thinking in React" with reactivity based on the Redux-toolkit and Reef.js lib.
 
## Features for Developers

-   This Starter Kit focused on creating App based on predictable Flux architecture
-   Focused on modern JS
-   Used optional type checking by JSDoc + VSCode + Typescript (tsc)
-   HTML-in-JS (plain HTML in plain JS) instead of JSX
-   Bootstrap (without jquery and popper.js) for simple CSS
-   Bootstrap's CSS is reducing with Auto-Purge, while build creating
-   Separation of App logic and UI
-   Components architecture, rely on predictable RTK style
-   All RTK features: Redux Dev Tools, slices, immer, etc.
-   Jest and @testing-library/dom for tests
-   @babel for: es6 to es5 and correct work with jest & ESM modules
-   Automatic generation of html documentation from JSDoc + docdash as a nice looking template for JSDoc
-   Automatic README.md generation from JSDoc
-   Husky: for hooks
-   Flexibility. Feel free to change one library from this starter kit to another. For example you can change Redux-toolkit to vanilla Redux for reduce size of final bundle. Feel free to experimenting.
